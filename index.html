				<h3>Why the Need to Preserve our Culture?</h3>
				<p>First is to know our roots, we may say that it is where we came from or our origin as Filipinos, it is what shaped us to be the people we are today. And that we can also express or show our culture to today's youth since evolution is rapidly growing, some youths can no longer witness these practices.</p>
				<p>Second is tourism, when the world notices and acknowledged the beauty of our culture, they find time to visit our country specially the sights where everything began. So promoting our cultures can attract tourists that are interested in our practices and at the same time preserving it.</p>
				<p>And so we invite you to join us in this journey of reminiscing the beauty of old times. It is through our collective efforts that we will ensure the culture, traditions, and language of our people will continue for future generations to come.</p>

			<div class="participation">
				<h4>Participation</h4>
				<p>A big change will start from a small one. So, in order to attain our goal, we must start by participating in our tradition, whether be it on celebrations or just a simple "mano" to your elders is a start just as good as any. Visit your local museums and try to recommend them from your foreign relatives. Speak your ancestral language, cook family recipes among others. With your small actions, you're helping the bigger picture.</p>

			<div class="requirements">
				<h4>Requirements</h4>
				<p>There are absolutely no requirements! Just you and your knowledge of your own culture is what it takes to preserve what your ancestors did.</p>

				<h4>How do Foreigners see the Artistic Filipino?</h4>
				<p>As a foreigner with more than 30 years of experience around the globe and having the pleasure of seeing and interacting with the Filipino Culture both, here in the Philippines and abroad in several countries including the USA, Europe and Asia areas of the world, I find the finer side to be the Cultural Arts, mainly speaking of the dance and musical side of these very talented people.  This artistic side of the Filipino People is what has drawn me here to the Philippines time and time again.  Ultimately this had been a driving force for me to eventually come to the Philippines to live, more specifically in the Northern portion of the country called the Cordillera’s Region, Baguio City located in the province of Benguet some 300 kilometers north of the country’s capital city of Manila.</p>
				<p>Performance Arts are by far my favorite.  Historically drama before the Spanish colonization was of a religious nature and was intended to persuade the deities to provide the necessities of life.  The Spanish used drama to introduce the Catholic religion.  Filipino themes in drama developed in the late nineteenth century as the independence movement evolved.  Current themes are nationalistic and reflect daily life as a mixture of Catholic and old school beliefs as an art form.</p>
				<p>Dance is a mixture of Filipino and Spanish cultures.  Professional dance troupes as I have seen around the world perform ballet, modern dance, and folk dance.  Folk dances are performed at meetings and conferences and reflect a strong Spanish influence.  Indigenous dances are used in historical pageants and are by far my favorite style of dance to watch.  As example, the bamboo dance relating a story about a bird moving among the reeds of bamboo.  People enjoy ballroom dancing for recreation.  Dance instructors are available at parties to teach the waltz and the cha-cha while the most popular style of the Filipino cha-cha can be seen worldwide where ever Filipinos are, this type of cha-cha is sure to follow.</p>
				<p>Music performance begins in the home, then at school.  Amateur performances featuring song and dance occur at fiestas.  Popular music tends to be American.  This is one of the most attracted scene noticed by people in countries outside of the Philippines, when a Filipino band is playing and the lady singers are dancing, the entire crowd is sure to fall in love with the pure talent of the Filipino people.  After talking to many foreigners who are visiting the Philippines, their answer to the real reason they decided to visit this beautiful country is that “they watched a musical show put on by Filipinos back in their home country”.</p>

				<h4>Cañao</h4>
				<p>This dance is a socio-religious ritual where pigs, chickens or carabaos are feasted as thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest, to signal another season of plantation, as part of weddings or to celebrate the birth of a new member of the community.</p>
				<p>The Cañao is slowly fading because some Cordillerans are finally embracing Christian faith, though it is still practiced in occasions such as marriage and feasts. The preservation of this culture should benefit the pride of the local Cordillerans and to bring back the practice and the joy of celebration.</p>

			<div class="story" id="bahag">
				<h4>Bahag</h4>
				<p>The Bahag or Loincloth continues to be used by the ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordilleras. It is a hand-loomed long cloth that is wrapped around a man’s middle. The Bahag is not just a cover of the groin and buttocks but it is also a statement of one’s class in the community or the society, the designs on the Bahag would distinguish the rich from the poor. But nowadays in the Cordilleras, anyone can wear the Bahag often with many colors and different designs.</p>
				<p>Preservation of this culture for the ethnolinguistic groups or indigenous groups around the Mountain Province can bring out their pride as the people of the Cordilleras.</p>
